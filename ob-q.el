;;; Commentary:

;; This file adds support for evaluating q (kdb+/q) code blocks in org-babel.

;;; Requirements:
;;; for session support, q-mode is needed

;;; Code:

;; (require 'org-macs)
;;(org-assert-version)

(require 'org)
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-eval)
;; (require 'org-macs)
;; (require 'q-mode) ;; Require q-mode for interactive support
